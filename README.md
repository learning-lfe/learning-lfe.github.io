# Weird weird weird....



## Lisp is weird, right?



## Then again Erlang is weird too.



Lisp, the weird language been in the computers since the early dawn of what they call "technology". Lisp for the modern era seems too ugly to read. Anyone who tries to do it first goes: 



> My eyes hurts... I see nothing than parentheses.



> You said this will work. How can it work? It has less LOC than my Java program and it doesn't look like Ruby or Python.



But fear not my friend, if you're reading this then we can assure that you and me weren't the person who said that. We felt curious. Though much parentheses to view at first, we looked at those codes and were amazed by the action packed in those powerful codes.   


Now, let's talk about Erlang. Wow, what an idea. If someone asks to program for a million core machine, Erlang developer go like "This is what we do".



So, what happens if we mix this power-packed Erlang VM \(BEAM\) with the most powerful language ever made "Lisp". 



> We get LFE.



Yes, my friend LFE. Lisp Flavored Erlang. The same Lisp we have loved in the most action packed VM with total Erlang interoperability. 



Now, what awaits in this maddening journey is the power which will make the dark lord flee. 





The force is very strong with LFE.





Now, in this journey, you will learn to embrace and harness the force and use it to conquer in any sith-core-machines.
